# Tracking_Veterinaries
This is a web app used to provide a better visualization for data of top 100 Veterinarians in Mumbai along with various features to ensure timely care given to
animals, which is the first step to maintain animal health. Our project will help people find veterinarians at nearby locations across Mumbai and provide
best care to the animals. It will provide verified details of veterinarians in real time. We provide multiple spatial and non-spatial filters as well.
The dataset was unavailable for this project, hence it was webscraped from the JustDial website using Python's Beatutiful SOAP library.
